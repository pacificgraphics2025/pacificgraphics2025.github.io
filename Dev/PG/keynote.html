        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>The rise of end-to-end data-driven approaches such as deep learning and generative AI has cast doubt on classical graphics approaches built on explicit, carefully engineered algorithms. In this talk, I will argue that these classical techniques will remain to be fundamental components of visual computing pipelines, and will further be the main driving force towards addressing issues with controllability, interpretability, efficiency, and data scarcity. I will use our recent works as examples to show that insights from classical methods can be used as principled loss functions that provide guarantees for data-driven methods, as preconditioners that accelerate optimization, and as forward models for challenging inverse problems. These examples illustrate how classical techniques can both be adapted to combine with data-driven methods, or can be used standalone when there is not enough data. Finally, I will share some thoughts on the state of the field and a path forward.</p>

      <h4>Abstract:</h4>
      <p>After the introduction of foundation models around 2020, we are witnessing many advancements of AI beyond supervised learning, especially in languages, images, and videos. However, the sea of data to train such models often struggles to grasp structural or contextual reasoning in some problems. While there are still ongoing advances to develop 3D foundation models, I would like to share what we have observed to tackle 3D tasks using 2D foundation models. They are surprisingly effective in extracting semantics from rendered 3D assets, while it requires significant effort to deduce fine-grained spatial contexts. While the optimal representation might be yet to be found, geometric knowledge can complement powerful foundation models and guide us to understand the structure of the world.</p>

        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>As visual analytics continues to mature, so too must our understanding of its conceptual foundations. In this talk, I propose a framing of visualization in terms of functions, spaces, and grammar, offering a perspective aimed at formalizing how visualizations mediate between data, analytic tasks, and reasoning. We begin with the notion of visualization as a function: a mapping from data and interaction parameters to visual representations. This functional view, illustrated through systems like NeuralCubes, positions visualizations as surrogates for query execution. More broadly, it invites us to consider query spaces: the range of potential questions a visualization can support, suggest, or help refine. At the heart of this framing is the concept of design-specific transformations, where visual encodings embed analytic computation directly into their form. A pie chart, for example, does more than display values; it pre-computes part-to-whole relationships, reducing cognitive effort and guiding interpretation. These often-invisible transformations shape the interpretive work a visualization performs and influence the kinds of questions it can help answer. Making them explicit allows us to more precisely describe a visualization’s analytic affordances. Building on this, we introduce a hypothesis grammar, a conceptual framework that captures the structure of analytic questions. This grammar makes it possible to represent ambiguous or underspecified queries as modifiable query spaces. By aligning user tasks with data transformations and visual encodings, it helps enumerate the space of testable questions a visual analytics system can meaningfully support. Together, these ideas suggest a path toward a more formal theory of visual analytics. By conceptualizing visualizations as functions, spaces, and grammars, we can bring data, task, and visual design into a unified framework—one that offers a more rigorous and operational foundation for the visual analytics community.</p>
