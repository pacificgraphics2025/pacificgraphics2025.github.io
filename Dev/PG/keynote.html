        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>The rise of end-to-end data-driven approaches such as deep learning and generative AI has cast doubt on classical graphics approaches built on explicit, carefully engineered algorithms. In this talk, I will argue that these classical techniques will remain to be fundamental components of visual computing pipelines, and will further be the main driving force towards addressing issues with controllability, interpretability, efficiency, and data scarcity. I will use our recent works as examples to show that insights from classical methods can be used as principled loss functions that provide guarantees for data-driven methods, as preconditioners that accelerate optimization, and as forward models for challenging inverse problems. These examples illustrate how classical techniques can both be adapted to combine with data-driven methods, or can be used standalone when there is not enough data. Finally, I will share some thoughts on the state of the field and a path forward.</p>

      <h3>Abstract:</h3>
      <p>After the introduction of foundation models around 2020, we are witnessing many advancements of AI beyond supervised learning, especially in languages, images, and videos. However, the sea of data to train such models often struggles to grasp structural or contextual reasoning in some problems. While there are still ongoing advances to develop 3D foundation models, I would like to share what we have observed to tackle 3D tasks using 2D foundation models. They are surprisingly effective in extracting semantics from rendered 3D assets, while it requires significant effort to deduce fine-grained spatial contexts. While the optimal representation might be yet to be found, geometric knowledge can complement powerful foundation models and guide us to understand the structure of the world.</p>

        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>The next frontier in autonomy, spanning self-navigating drones, agile robots, and intelligent vehicles, demands more than advanced sensors. It requires a profound, actionable understanding of the world. This transformation is being driven by intelligent graphics.


        This keynote will explore how advanced graphics provide the computational foundation for spatial intelligence, converting raw sensor data into dynamic, navigable 3D worlds. We will uncover how these techniques empower machines to move beyond mere perception to genuine reasoning: interpreting complex environments, enabling robust planning, and making critical decisions in real-time. Ultimately, this is about closing the loop between seeing and doing, allowing autonomous systems to not only perceive their surroundings but to act within them intelligently and safely.</p>

        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>This Lifetime Achievement Award lecture reflects on over four decades of Professor Kunwoo Lee’s contributions to CAD, computer graphics, and digital engineering. The journey began with early research on hierarchical assembly modeling and automatic assembling procedure generation, advancing CAD systems beyond simple geometry to capture complex relationships. Subsequent work is on extending conventional CAD system for human-centered design, including parametric human body modeling and biomedical applications, demonstrating the direct societal impact of engineering research. More recent efforts focus on extending CAD for 3D printing, enabling internal structural optimization and fully integrated solid-and-void designs. Alongside research, contributions to education, textbooks, knowledge sharing, and industrial applications have fostered collaboration, interdisciplinary growth, and global recognition for Asian researchers. The lecture concludes with reflections on the importance of collaboration, teaching, and human-centered research, and offers guidance to young researchers on curiosity, resilience, interdisciplinarity, and societal impact in the evolving landscape of digital design and engineering.</p>
