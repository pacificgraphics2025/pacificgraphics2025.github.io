        We welcome original, unpublished submissions in all areas of computer graphics and its applications. The topics
        include (but are not limited to)
        modeling, rendering, animation, imaging, visualization, human-computer interaction, and graphics systems.
        Pacific Graphics 2025 will have two integrated paper
        tracks: Journal (Computer Graphics Forum) and Conference:

        <ul>
          <br>
          <li>
            <b>Journal Papers</b> containing high-quality original and unpublished results are solicited for the journal
            track, and will be published in a special issue of Computer Graphics
            Forum (CGF), the journal of the Eurographics Association, in print and online in 2025. Each paper is
            recommended to be 10-12 pages in length.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Conference Papers</b> are expected to present novel and unpublished research advancing computer graphics
            and applications. However, the evidence supporting
            these advances might not be as comprehensive as expected for Journal Papers. Papers accepted to this track
            will be published in the PG2025 proceedings
            in the EG digital library. Each paper is recommended to be 7-8 pages in length, not including bibliography
            and figure-only pages.
          </li>
          <br>
        </ul>

        All papers should be submitted through the <a class="w3-text-red"
          href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/PG_2025">SRM system for papers</a>.
        At submission time, authors can indicate if their submission should be considered for the Journal
        track only or for both tracks. The review process, deadline, and committee are the same for both tracks. The
        review process is doubly anonymous.
        Each paper receives reviews from the committee and external tertiary reviewers. Authors will have opportunities
        to address reviewers' concerns
        in a rebuttal period after the first cycle of reviewing before decisions are made.

        <br>
        <br>
        For any questions concerning full paper submissions, please do not hesitate to contact the paper program
        co-chairs via <a href="mailto:chairs-pg2025@eg.org">chairs-pg2025@eg.org</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition, the conference will also include <b>poster sessions</b>. All posters should be submitted through
        the SRM system for posters. The posters should be no more than 2 pages. The submission will be reviewed by the
        committee members and need to be anonymized.
